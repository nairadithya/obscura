This is the repository containing the source code for my browser extension *obscura*.

I'm using [[http:wxt.dev/][wxt]] to develop the extension. It's written in vanilla TypeScript with no frontend framework.

The extension itself is straightforward:

- It converts the reels feed to a static reel page, so you can only see at most one reel, this allows for intentional reel watching.
- Removes the AI Studio, Threads, Explore And Reels buttons.
  
* Usage
Clone the repo and run,

#+begin_src bash :noeval
bun i
bun dev
#+end_src

To start a local browser with the extension installed.
