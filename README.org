#+title: Obscura
#+author: Adithya Nair

This is the repository containing the source code for my browser extension *obscura*.

I'm using [[http:wxt.dev/][wxt]] to develop the extension. It's written in vanilla TypeScript with no frontend framework.

* Usage
Clone the repo and run,

#+begin_src bash
bun i
bun dev
#+end_src

To start a local browser with the extension installed
